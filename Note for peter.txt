What we told Jude
Hiya Jude,

Just the weekly 'what we want you to do' message! This week it's quite simple:
- Researching Sound Tools
    - This is just researching what other games have done in terms of sound, how they implement it, what tools they use/need to create, etc.
    - Try to make a list or document of what is to be created or used
    - Also, see what unity has to offer. Maybe there's some neat tools they have for us to use!
- IF ABOVE IS DONE:
    - Make a head start on the notes as we discussed yesterday.
        - This is writing up the notes, and making something in the UI so that they are written up

It's understandable if you can't get the second part done because of your computer, but try to at least complete the first part!

Thanks,
Pete

What he has done
 - He decided to put it in the discord and not on a document
 - He hasn't looked at tools
 - He has put his infomation about his scripts into the script document - need to look at, maybe he is doing the code documentation that I have asked for people to do
 - On the stuff for sound he starts off by saying "As my work today (28th of january) is sound tools, I'll just comment on anything interesting I find while researching."

I have seen some code and there is something that I have seen that is rasing an eyebrow but does explain why Jude couldn't use the door, Joseph fucked up

Idea for my side project
In the news article about the compnay that nick works for, the news interview him about the company not funding homless shelters
One way to show that he is a good citizen is to show him helping out the community without being asked
